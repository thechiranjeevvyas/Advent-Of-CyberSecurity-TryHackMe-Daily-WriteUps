## 🔍 Scenario Summary

An unexpected crisis unfolds in Wareville — **McSkidy has gone missing**. With security concerns escalating and holiday operations at stake, the investigation begins immediately.

The first technical lead points toward **tbfc-web01**, a Linux server responsible for managing Christmas wishlist data. The assumption is simple but critical: if McSkidy interacted with this system recently, the operating system may still retain traces of those actions.

Day 01 focuses on using **basic Linux command-line techniques** to explore the system and understand how user activity is recorded.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Investigation

### 📌 Task 1 — Mission Context

The challenge opens with a narrative briefing that frames the disappearance and introduces the opposing force behind the incident. Visual storytelling elements hint that technology played a role, setting expectations for a technical investigation rather than a purely fictional one.

This task establishes _why_ the server matters and _what_ the investigator should be looking for.

---

### 📌 Task 2 — Command-Line Fundamentals

The next step involves interacting directly with the Linux system using essential CLI commands:

- Navigating directories to understand system structure
- Listing files to identify available data
- Checking the current working location to avoid confusion
- Reading files carefully without altering their contents

These actions enable safe exploration while preserving potential evidence.

---

### 📌 Task 3 — Filesystem Examination

A structured review of the filesystem was carried out, covering:

- Core Linux directories
- User home locations
- Configuration and log-related paths
- Hidden files that are not visible by default

During this process, patterns emerged that suggested the system had been accessed shortly before McSkidy disappeared.

---

### 📌 Task 4 — Activity & Log Analysis

The final technical task involved reviewing stored activity records, including:

- System and authentication logs
- User command histories
- Login timestamps and session details

By correlating these records, it became possible to reconstruct portions of McSkidy’s last interaction with the server.
